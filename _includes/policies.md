### Submitting:
+ All homeworks should be turned in electronically to **myCourses**. 
+ Paper submissions may be **scanned** in if legible.
+ If you take a **photo** of your paper solution, please take the photo outside or close to a bright **window**, for legibility.

### Due dates:
+ Homeworks are due by **10pm** on the due date (Thu).
+ **No late** submissions are accepted.
+ If there are **extenuating circumstances**, contact the instructor as soon
as possible to make arrangements.

### References:
+ If you find a resource helpful (from **internet search**, blog post,
  Stack Overflow, online courses, our lecture notes, etc),
  be sure to **cite** it.
  Citation format doesn't matter, but make it easy for the TA
  to **find** the source: e.g., a clickable link.
+ Code / pseudocode should be your **own work**.
  If you find code online, **understand** how it works,
  then go write up your solution on your **own**.
+ The basic **machine model** was discussed in [Lecture 1](/lec1/#/7).
  Don't use **library** functions which obviate the bulk of
  a question.  E.g., if you're asked to implement a sort, don't use
  Python's `sorted()`.
